          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <div class="well">
            <p>
              This section of the project was centered on the mesh simplification component of the preprocessor. 
            </p>
            <p>
              3D triangle mesh simplification is currently a well-defined and very mature area of research with many complex algorithms. Some of these algorithms are feely available in open source mesh processing packages, therefore, we decided to implement and adapt an existing solution into a component that could be used within our preprocessor.
            </p>

            <p>
              The research question I sought to answer is: 
              “Can an existing mesh simplification implementation be adapted to work with an out-of core hierarchical level of detail mesh scheme?.”
            </p>
            </div>

          <h3>Design and Implementation</h3>
          <div class="well">
            <p>
              The design and implementation of the simplifier tool (known as SimplFy) were heavily guided by experimenting with the Tridecimator simplifier found in VCG (a Quadric Error Edge Collapse implementation). Following a visual inspection of meshes simplified with this algorithm, and due to its poor documentation. We attempted to gain an understanding of the VCG implementation by refactoring its code into a new design.
            </p>

              <img class="img-well-white" src="images/simplifier/design.png" alt="Simplifier design">
              <p><em>Figure 1 - Simplifier design. Green are elements are based on VCGlib implementation, blue elements are customized/new</em></p>
            </div>

            <p>
              The pre-processor spatially divides the mesh into chunks. Each of these chunks is then simplified before being re-stitched together.
            </p>

            <div class="image-with-caption">
              <img  class="img-well-white" src="images/simplifier/seams.png" alt="Seams" style="width:400px;height:230">
              <p><em>Figure 2 - Seams are formed when the edges of mesh chunks (sections) are deformed before being stitched back together</em></p>
            </div>

            <p>
              The creation of seams can be avoided by enabling Tridecimators boundary preservation, however, this includes the boundaries surrounding any holes in a mesh. Meshes cannot be simplified beyond this boundary face count without detail compromising artefacts. 
            </p>

              <img class="image-multiple-white" src="images/simplifier/gede borders.png" alt="Gede with boundary triangles selected">
              <img class="image-multiple-white" src="images/simplifier/gedeheavysimpborder.png" alt="Gede  simplified heavily with boundary preservation enabled">
              <p><em>Figure 3 - Gede, left with all border triangles (~125 000) highlighted in red, right Gede is simplified to ~125 000 triangles with border preservation enabled</em></p>
            </div>


            <p>
              The simplifier was adapted by enabling support for coloured vertices, post simplification mesh cleaning and a by redefining how border triangles are identified.  The pre-processor specifies a bounding box that defines the mesh volume of the mesh chunk. All triangles that intersect or exist outside of the bounding box are defined as boundary triangles. The rectangular edges of each chunk are then preserved until they are stitched together.
            </p>

            </div>
          <h3>Results</h3>
          <div class="well">
          <p>
          Meshes were pre-processed with SimplFy and Tridecimator. These processed meshes were then visually compared to evaluate the changes made in SimplFy. The final version of the pre-processor creates a level of detail hiararchy with the root node containing the full mesh simplified down to 400 000 faces.
